### Hello,

This is Saurav Kumar working as Data Engineer in Wipro. 

In my work currently, I use `SSIS` to handle all of my ETL use cases and `SSMS` for all the data definition and manipulation tasks. In my current role I have written many complex 
and efficient T-SQL queries to make the data ready to be analysed. I believe , I have a good intution for the data which I have developed through consistent practise.Apart 
from my professional life, I have a personal curiosity of scraping and analysing the data from the topics I'm interested in for eg [IPL](https://github.com/sauravkmr992/IPL2020) , [Laliga](https://github.com/sauravkmr992/Scraping_Analysing_Laliga_20-21) etc. My purpose basically is to find out interesting insights which normally doesn't come up. I'm glad that I've shared it on Github.

## Education and Profession

### Data Engineer

Wipro *Mar 2020 - Present*

Here I have been writing **T-SQL** and **python** scripts to load ,transform and analyse the data in the required format and I also automate these scripts using `SQL Server agent` and `schedule` python library to load the data from file to `SQL Server`. I use window functions, stored procedures, UDFs,views, sub-queries, SSIS etc to accomplish my day-to-day task. 

### DL Enginner

Wipro *Aug 2019-Jan 2020*

Here, I have worked for shorter duration as a programmer in the project 'Anamoly detection in pipes'. My work involved writing python scripts to augment the image data for the imbalanced classes and also to find the sweet spot between precision and recall score. We used a Pre-trained model `Resnet` for object detection and `OpenVINO` from intel to optimize the model in the end. Tools and libraries I used here was Tensorflow, Jupyter ,labelIMG and OpenVINO.

### ML Intern

Wipro *Feb 2019-May2019*

As an intern we were given the task to predict the ***condition of Industrial Components*** based on the data coming out from smart sensors. Here my task was to remove the redundant feature from the dataset and also to create a model that could identify the developing anamoly in the industrial components. Firstly,I used few ensemble models and logistic regression for prediction then finalized with XGBoost as the precision was higher for this model and also suited for the use case. I also successfully defended this project as my *thesis* in the M.Tech summer internship.

### Integrated(B.Tech + M.Tech) ECE 

Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida  *Aug 2014-May 2019*

I completed my degree with specialisation in Tele-communication but caught my interest in Machine Learning during my M.Tech summer internship. I had a great time learning 
and practising Embedded C for my VLSI projects and also had developed few image contrast enhancement projects using Matlab.
